##### USES PREPROCESSED IMAGE(hairremoval and uint8 changed, and quality check)

"""
feature_C.py

This module computes the color variation score of a lesion using its original image and corresponding binary mask.
The score is calculated as the sum of standard deviations of R, G, and B pixel values within the masked region.

Higher scores indicate more color variation â€” often associated with melanoma.

    Computes a color variation score based on RGB channel standard deviations

    Parameters:
        image_path (str): Path to the original lesion image.
